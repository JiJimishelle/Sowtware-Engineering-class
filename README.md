This is the password generator program that is written with Python programming language. 
I'll try to explain it using Waterfall model which is a linear sequential approach to the software development lifecycle.

1. Requirements analysis and specification phase:
The aim of this phase is to understand the exact requirements of the customer and to document them properly.
Requirements for the password generator below:
- Mixing upper-case and lower-case letters
- Adding numbers or other keyboard characters
- Determining the number of each character to be included

2.Design Phase: Aims to transform the requirements gathered in the SRS into a suitable form which permits further coding in a programming language.

The code consists of two main functions:
- get_user_input: Takes user input to determine the password requirements.
- generate_pass: Generates a password based on the provided parameters.

3.Implementation and unit testing:
Design is implemented and during testing, the code is thoroughly examined and modified.

Python standard libraries: 
- import random: generate random numbers
- import string: string manipulation utilities

4.Integration and System testing:
The quality of the end product is determined by the effectiveness of the testing carried out. You can see my code in code section~~

5.Operation and maintenance:
Maintenance is the task performed by every user once the software has been delivered to the customer, installed, and operational
- After deployment, the code may require maintenance to address any issues or updates.
- Changes to password requirements or enhancements to the generator can be implemented in this phase.
